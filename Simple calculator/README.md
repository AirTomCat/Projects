# Simple GUI Calculator

A basic graphical user interface (GUI) calculator application built using Python and its standard `tkinter` library. This project provides a user-friendly interface for performing simple arithmetic calculations.

## Features

-   Performs basic arithmetic operations: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
-   Includes a display screen to show the current expression and the result.
-   A **Clear (C)** button to reset the input field.
-   Simple error handling for invalid expressions (e.g., `5 * * 3`) and division by zero.
-   A clean and intuitive user interface.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x

The `tkinter` library is included in the Python standard library, so no additional package installations are required.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Save the Python script as `gui_calculator.py`.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/folder
    ```
    For example:
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\kevin\Documents
    ```
5.  Run the application with the following command:
    ```bash
    python gui_calculator.py
    ```
The calculator window will then appear on your screen.
